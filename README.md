## Overview:
An interactive eye-tracking game demo, targetted towards individuals with physical-limitations, with the purpose of subtly familiarizing users with the eye-tracking hardware device functional features. The game is intended to subtly familiarize users with utilizing an eye-tracker hardware device.
## Gameplay:
On startup, the demo will begin after the interactive-icon is activated. The player's focal-vision (constrolled by a supported Eye-Tracking device) is indicated via a red dot on the screen.
<br/><br/>
Once the game begins, the neighboring-village centered on the screen will be bombarded by abnormal-disasters from the God of Calamity. The player is tasked with subverting the onslought of disaster-hazards (meteors, falling ships, fire-spread) by focusing their vision directly onto the hazards to successfull diminish the threat to befall the village.
