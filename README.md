## Overview:
Our main objectives of our project were to make a video game that was fully utilizes the functionality of an HUD-compliant eye-tracking device and to publish the game on the Microsoft Store. The game is intended to subtly familiarize users with utilizing an eye-tracker hardware device.

On startup, the demo will begin after the interactive-icon is activated. Once the game begins, the neighboring-village centered on the screen will be bombarded by abnormal-disasters from the God of Calamity. The player is tasked with subverting the onslought of disaster-hazards (meteors, falling ships, fire-spread) by focusing their vision directly onto the hazards to successfull diminish the threat to befall the village.
